              Timber is frequently salvage‐logged following high‐severity stand‐replacing wildfire, but the practice is controversial. One concern is that compound disturbances could result in more deleterious impacts than either disturbance individually, with mechanical operations having the potential to set back recovering native species and increase invasion by non‐native species. Following the 2002 Cone Fire on the Lassen National Forest, three replicates of five salvage treatments were applied to 15 units formerly dominated by ponderosa pine, covering a range of disturbance intensities from unsalvaged to 100\% salvaged. Understory species richness and cover data were collected every two years between 2006 and 2012. Richness of both native and non‐native species did not differ among salvage treatments, but both showed strong changes over time. While cover of forbs and graminoids did not differ with salvage treatment, cover of shrubs was significantly reduced at the higher salvage intensities. The three main shrub species are all stimulated to germinate by fire, potentially leaving seedlings vulnerable to any mechanical disturbance occurring immediately postgermination. Many other native perennial species emerge from rhizomes or other deeply buried underground structures and appear to be less affected by salvage harvest. Over time, the plant community in all salvage treatments shifted from dominance by shrubs and forbs to shrubs and grasses. Most of the grasses were native, except 
              Bromus tectorum 
              (cheatgrass), which was found in 4\% of measurement quadrats in 2006 and 52\% in 2012. Our results indicated that understory vegetation change 4–10 years post‐high‐severity wildfire appeared to be influenced more strongly by factors other than salvage logging.},

              Increases in burned area across the western United States (US) since the mid‐1980s have been widely documented and linked partially to climate factors, yet evaluations of trends in
              fire severity

The relationships we identified between the annual fire severity metrics and climate, as well as the observed and projected trend toward warmer and drier fire seasons, suggest that climate change will contribute to increased fire severity in future decades where fuels remain abundant. The growing prevalence of high‐severity fire in western US forests has important implications to forest ecosystems, including an increased probability of fire‐catalyzed conversions from forest to alternative vegetation types.

            Plain Language Summary
            The physical and ecological effects of wildfire (hereafter fire severity) have important consequences in terms of soil erosion, carbon storage, forest succession, wildlife habitat, and human safety and infrastructure. This study evaluated changes in fire severity in western US forests from 1985 to 2017 and tested whether fire severity varied with fire‐season climate. Results show that area burned at high severity increased across most of the study area, with an overall eightfold increase in western US forests from 1985 to 2017. Furthermore, warmer and drier fire seasons corresponded with higher severity fire, indicating that continued climate change may result in increased fire severity in future decades. One potential consequence of greater area burned at high severity is an increased probability that forests will convert to alternative vegetation types. Our findings provide some guidance to managers as society struggles to better coexist with fire. For example, it may be possible to increase the prevalence of low‐ and moderate‐severity fire, sometimes referred to as “good fire”, through thoughtful planning about where and when to implement a less aggressive fire suppression response. Similar to prescribed fires that promote forest resilience, unplanned fires that burn during less‐than‐extreme fire seasons have the potential to serve as effective “fuel treatments”.

We found that where fires occurred, the odds of high‐severity fire on “private industrial” lands were 1.8 times greater than on “public” lands and 1.9 times greater than on “other” lands (that is, remaining lands classified as neither private industrial nor public). Moreover, high‐severity fire incidence was greater in areas adjacent to private industrial land, indicating this trend extends across ownership boundaries.

              Background 
              Wildfires in the Pacific Northwest (Washington, Oregon, Idaho, and western Montana, USA) have been immense in recent years, capturing the attention of resource managers, fire scientists, and the general public. This paper synthesizes understanding of the potential effects of changing climate and fire regimes on Pacific Northwest forests, including effects on disturbance and stress interactions, forest structure and composition, and post-fire ecological processes. We frame this information in a risk assessment context, and conclude with management implications and future research needs. 
             
             
              Results 
              Large and severe fires in the Pacific Northwest are associated with warm and dry conditions, and such conditions will likely occur with increasing frequency in a warming climate. According to projections based on historical records, current trends, and simulation modeling, protracted warmer and drier conditions will drive lower fuel moisture and longer fire seasons in the future, likely increasing the frequency and extent of fires compared to the twentieth century. Interactions between fire and other disturbances, such as drought and insect outbreaks, are likely to be the primary drivers of ecosystem change in a warming climate. Reburns are also likely to occur more frequently with warming and drought, with potential effects on tree regeneration and species composition. Hotter, drier sites may be particularly at risk for regeneration failures. 
             
             
              Conclusion 
              Resource managers will likely be unable to affect the total area burned by fire, as this trend is driven strongly by climate. However, fuel treatments, when implemented in a spatially strategic manner, can help to decrease fire intensity and severity and improve forest resilience to fire, insects, and drought. Where fuel treatments are less effective (wetter, high-elevation, and coastal forests), managers may consider implementing fuel breaks around high-value resources. When and where post-fire planting is an option, planting different genetic stock than has been used in the past may increase seedling survival. Planting seedlings on cooler, wetter microsites may also help to increase survival. In the driest topographic locations, managers may need to consider where they will try to forestall change and where they will allow conversions to vegetation other than what is currently dominant.

            Resumen 
             
              Antecedentes 
              Los incendios de vegetación en el Noroeste del pacífico (Washington, Oregon, Idaho, y el oeste de Montana, EEUU), han sido inmensos en años recientes, capturando la atención de los gestores de recursos, de científicos dedicados a los incendios, y del público en general. Este trabajo sintetiza el conocimiento de los efectos potenciales del cambio climático y de los regímenes de fuego en bosques del noroeste del Pacífico, incluyendo los efectos sobre las interacciones entre disturbios y distintos estreses, la estructura y composición de los bosques, y los procesos ecológicos posteriores. Encuadramos esta información en el contexto de la determinación del riesgo, y concluimos con implicancias en el manejo y la necesidad de futuras investigaciones. 
             
             
              Resultados 
              Los incendios grandes y severos en el Noroeste del Pacífico están asociados con condiciones calurosas y secas, y tales condiciones muy probablemente ocurran con el incremento en la frecuencia del calentamiento global. De acuerdo a proyecciones basadas en registros históricos, tendencias actuales y modelos de simulación, condiciones prolongadas de aumento de temperaturas y sequías conducirán a menores niveles de humedad, incrementando probablemente la frecuencia y extensión de fuegos en el futuro, en comparación con lo ocurrido durante el siglo XX. Las interacciones entre el fuego y otros disturbios, son probablemente los principales conductores de cambios en los ecosistemas en el marco del calentamiento global. Los incendios recurrentes podrían ocurrir más frecuentemente con aumentos de temperatura y sequías, con efectos potenciales en la regeneración de especies forestales y en la composición de especies. Los sitios más cálidos y secos, pueden estar particularmente en riesgo por fallas en la regeneración. 
             
             
              Conclusiones 
              Los gestores de recursos no podrían tener ningún efecto sobre el área quemada, ya que esta tendencia está fuertemente influenciada por el clima. Sin embargo, el tratamiento de combustibles, cuando está implementado de una manera espacialmente estratégica, puede ayudar a reducir la intensidad y severidad de los incendios, y mejorar la resiliencia de los bosques al fuego, insectos, y sequías. En lugares en los que el tratamiento de combustibles es menos efectivo (áreas más húmedas, elevadas, y bosques costeros) los gestores deberían considerar implementar barreras de combustible alrededor de valores a proteger. Cuando y donde la plantación post fuego sea una opción, plántulas provenientes de diferentes stocks genéticos de aquellos que han sido usados en el pasado pueden incrementar su supervivencia. La plantación de plántulas en micrositios más húmedos y fríos podría ayudar también a incrementar la supervivencia de plántulas. En ubicaciones topográficas más secas, los gestores deberían considerar evitar cambios y donde estos sean posibles, permitir conversiones a tipos de vegetación diferentes a las actualmente dominantes.},

            Theory predicts that network characteristics may help anticipate how populations and communities respond to extreme climatic events, but local environmental context may also influence responses to extreme events. For example, altered fire regimes in many ecosystems may significantly affect the context for how species and communities respond to changing climate. In this study, I tested whether the responses of a pollinator community to extreme drought were influenced by the surrounding diversity of fire histories (pyrodiversity) which can influence their interaction networks via changing partner availability. I found that at the community level, pyrodiverse landscapes promote functional complementarity and generalization, but did not consistently enhance functional redundancy or resistance to simulated co‐extinction cascades. Pyrodiversity instead supported flexible behaviors that enable populations to resist perturbations. Specifically, pollinators that can shift partners and network niches are better able to take advantage of the heterogeneity generated by pyrodiversity, thereby buffering pollinator populations against changes in plant abundances. These findings suggest that pyrodiversity is unlikely to improve community‐level resistance to droughts, but instead promotes population resistance and community functionality. This study provides unique evidence that resistance to extreme climatic events depends on both network properties and historical environmental context.},

Direct effects include mortality, injury, and displacement affecting at most two generations – adults and any immature progeny present during the fire. To study the direct effects of fire on bees, two criteria must be met. First, bees must be sampled soon after the fire event, before colonists arrive from outside the burn. Second, sampling locations must be far enough into the burned habitat to ensure that bees observed are survivors, and not foragers nesting outside the burn. 
            2. Bees were systematically sampled far inside ({\textgreater}7 km) and outside the burn perimeter immediately following a massive wildfire that burned primarily at night in sagebrush steppe habitat. Because adult females sleep in their nests, it was hypothesised that females of species with nests {\textgreater}10 cm underground would be safe from lethal heat, whereas females with shallow or above‐ground nests would be vulnerable. It was also hypothesised that fire would kill proportionately more males, as they typically sleep above ground. 
            3. Adult bees were present at all burned sample sites 14 and 21 days after the fire started. Many females were observed transporting pollen, indicative of active nest provisioning. Among the guild of bees surveyed at wild sunflowers (the only surviving flowering plant), fewer species were active within the burn. Guild composition was significantly altered, particularly by loss or depletion of several (but not all) sunflower specialists. Sex ratios did not shift, possibly due to surviving males aggregating in remaining patches of sunflowers.},

              Fire has a major impact on the structure and function of many ecosystems globally. Pyrodiversity, the diversity of fires within a region (where diversity is based on fire characteristics such as extent, severity, and frequency), has been hypothesized to promote biodiversity, but changing climate and land management practices have eroded pyrodiversity. To assess whether changes in pyrodiversity will have impacts on ecological communities, we must first understand the mechanisms that might enable pyrodiversity to sustain biodiversity, and how such changes might interact with other disturbances such as drought. Focusing on plant–pollinator communities in mixed‐conifer forest with frequent fire in Yosemite National Park, California, we examine how pyrodiversity, combined with drought intensity, influences those communities. We find that pyrodiversity is positively related to the richness of the pollinators, flowering plants, and plant–pollinator interactions. On average, a 5\% increase in pyrodiversity led to the gain of approximately one pollinator and one flowering plant species and nearly two interactions. We also find that a diversity of fire characteristics contributes to the spatial heterogeneity ( 
              β 
              ‐diversity) of plant and pollinator communities. Lastly, we find evidence that fire diversity buffers pollinator communities against the effects of drought‐induced floral resource scarcity. Fire diversity is thus important for the maintenance of flowering plant and pollinator diversity and predicted shifts in fire regimes to include less pyrodiversity compounded with increasing drought occurrence will negatively influence the richness of these communities in this and other forested ecosystems. In addition, lower heterogeneity of fire severity may act to reduce spatial turnover of plant–pollinator communities. The heterogeneity of community composition is a primary determinant of the total species diversity present in a landscape, and thus, lower pyrodiversity may negatively affect the richness of plant–pollinator communities across large spatial scales.},

              Large, high‐severity wildfires are an important component of disturbance regimes around the world and can influence the structure and function of forest ecosystems. Climatic changes and anthropogenic disturbances have altered global disturbance patterns and increased the frequency of high‐severity wildfires worldwide. While the recovery of plant communities at different successional stages after fire is well known, the influence of prior disturbances and stand age is poorly understood. Despite this, high‐intensity wildfires can produce long‐lasting legacy effects, which can influence the resistance and resilience of ecosystems. Here, we quantified the influence of prior stand age and disturbance history on the recovery of plant communities in the Mountain Ash and Alpine Ash forests of south‐eastern Australia after high‐severity wildfire. Specifically, controlling for stand age, we compared the abundance (percent cover) of different plant life forms and reproductive strategies in forests that were, at the time of high‐severity wildfire in 2009, “young” (28–35 yr old and previously logged), “mixed” age (26, 70–83, {\textgreater}150 yr old), “mature” (70–83 yr old), and “old‐growth” ({\textgreater}150 yr old). We uncovered evidence that the legacy of prior disturbance and stand age at the time of high‐severity wildfire can influence the recovery of plant communities in early successional forests. Specifically, we found that “young” forests burnt in 2009 had a higher abundance of ruderal and graminoid species, but had a lower abundance of persistent, onsite seeders, including

              and eucalypt species, relative to “old‐growth” forests burnt in 2009. “Mature” aged forests burnt in 2009 also had a lower abundance of 
              Acacia 
              , eucalypt, and shrub species, relative to “old‐growth forests” burnt in 2009. Our findings provide evidence of advanced recovery in forests that were older when burnt by high‐severity wildfire, relative to younger forests burnt by the same wildfire. Further, we also demonstrate the influence of different environmental conditions on plant communities. In a period of rapid, global, environmental change, our study provides insights into the recovery of plant communities post‐wildfire with implications for forest management. Further, our findings suggest that predicted increases in the frequency of high‐severity wildfires may have consequences for forest regeneration.},

	abstract = {Wildfires influence many temperate terrestrial ecosystems worldwide. Historical environmental heterogeneity created by wildfires has been altered by human activities and will be impacted by future climate change. Our ability to predict the impact of wildfire‐created heterogeneity on biodiversity is limited because few studies have investigated variation in community composition (beta‐diversity) in response to fire. Wildfires may influence beta‐diversity through several ecological mechanisms. First, high‐severity fires may decrease beta‐diversity by homogenizing species composition when they create landscapes dominated by disturbance‐tolerant or rapidly colonizing species. In contrast, mixed‐severity fires may increase beta‐diversity by creating mosaic landscapes containing habitats that support species with differing environmental tolerances and dispersal traits. Moreover, the effects of fire severity on beta‐diversity may change depending on site conditions. Disturbance is hypothesized to increase local species richness at higher productivity and decrease local species richness at lower productivity, a process that can have important, but largely unexamined, consequences on beta‐diversity in fire‐prone ecosystems. We tested these hypotheses by comparing patterns of beta‐diversity and species richness across 162 plant communities in three sites that span a large‐scale gradient in climate and productivity in the Northern Rockies of Montana. Within each site, we used spatially explicit fire‐severity data to stratify sampling across unburned forests and forests burned with mixed‐ and high‐severity wildfires. We found that beta‐diversity (community dispersion) of forbs was higher in mixed‐severity compared to high‐severity fire, regardless of productivity. Counter to our predictions, local species richness of forbs was higher in burned landscapes compared to unburned landscapes at the low‐productivity site, but lower in burned landscapes at the high‐productivity site. This pattern may be explained by rapid regeneration of woody plants after fire in high‐productivity forests. Moreover, forbs and woody plants had disproportionately higher overall species richness in mixed‐severity fire compared to high‐severity fire, but only at the low‐productivity site. These patterns suggest that mixed‐severity fires promote higher landscape‐level biodiversity in low‐productivity sites by increasing species turnover across landscapes with a diverse mosaic of habitats. Our study illustrates the importance of understanding the mechanisms by which patterns of wildfire severity interact with environmental gradients to influence patterns of biodiversity across spatial scales.},

Species life‐history traits represent an adaptive response to disturbance and are an information legacy; in contrast, the abiotic and biotic structures (such as seeds or nutrients) produced by single disturbance events are material legacies. Disturbance characteristics that support or maintain these legacies enhance ecological resilience and maintain a “safe operating space” for ecosystem recovery. However, legacies can be lost or diminished as disturbance regimes and environmental conditions change, generating a “resilience debt” that manifests only after the system is disturbed. Strong effects of ecological memory on post‐disturbance dynamics imply that contingencies (effects that cannot be predicted with certainty) of individual disturbances, interactions among disturbances, and climate variability combine to affect ecosystem resilience. We illustrate these concepts and introduce a novel ecosystem resilience framework with examples of forest disturbances, primarily from North America. Identifying legacies that support resilience in a particular ecosystem can help scientists and resource managers anticipate when disturbances may trigger abrupt shifts in forest ecosystems, and when forests are likely to be resilient.},

            Theory predicts that network characteristics may help anticipate how populations and communities respond to extreme climatic events, but local environmental context may also influence responses to extreme events. For example, altered fire regimes in many ecosystems may significantly affect the context for how species and communities respond to changing climate. In this study, I tested whether the responses of a pollinator community to extreme drought were influenced by the surrounding diversity of fire histories (pyrodiversity) which can influence their interaction networks via changing partner availability. I found that at the community level, pyrodiverse landscapes promote functional complementarity and generalization, but did not consistently enhance functional redundancy or resistance to simulated co‐extinction cascades. Pyrodiversity instead supported flexible behaviors that enable populations to resist perturbations. Specifically, pollinators that can shift partners and network niches are better able to take advantage of the heterogeneity generated by pyrodiversity, thereby buffering pollinator populations against changes in plant abundances. These findings suggest that pyrodiversity is unlikely to improve community‐level resistance to droughts, but instead promotes population resistance and community functionality. This study provides unique evidence that resistance to extreme climatic events depends on both network properties and historical environmental context.},

              Aim
              Wildfires increasingly create large high‐severity patches with interior areas far from less disturbed habitats. We evaluated how these trends impact bird communities by investigating the effect of internal distance from lower‐severity areas, high‐severity patch size, and years since fire on avian alpha and beta diversity.
            
            
              Location
              Sierra Nevada, California, USA.
            
            
              Methods
              Bird occurrence data were collected during 2009–2017 within high‐severity patches of 27 wildfires representing 1–30 years since disturbance. A two‐step multispecies occupancy method was used to account for imperfect detection of 94 species and estimate effects of patch characteristics on community richness and dissimilarity.
            
            
              Results
              Community richness decreased with distance from patch edge and with patch size. Richness increased with years since fire, but this pattern was dependent on distance from edge with higher peak richness (23 species) near edges than interiors (18 species). Community dissimilarity was not associated with distance, indicating that large high‐severity patch interiors contain subsets of, rather than complements to, edge communities. Dissimilarity peaked later with increasing patch size. Guild richness of tree and primary cavity nesters was negatively associated with distance and patch size. Richness of ground and shrub nesters was insensitive to distance, while shrub nester richness increased somewhat with patch size. Due to declines among other species, ground and shrub nesters made up a greater percentage of the avian community within the interiors of large high‐severity patches.
            
            
              Main conclusions
              As fire activity increases due to accumulating forest fuels and accelerating climate change, high‐severity patches and their resulting early‐seral habitats are becoming more extensive with less edge and more interior area. Such changes are likely to decrease avian diversity locally and shift community composition away from forest‐associated species. Management actions that promote the full range of fire effects but limit high‐severity patch size may best conserve bird diversity within fire‐adapted ecosystems.},

              To slow the rate of global species loss, it is imperative to understand how to restore and maintain native biodiversity in agricultural landscapes. Currently, agriculture is associated with lower spatial heterogeneity and turnover in community composition ( 
              β 
              ‐diversity). While some techniques are known to enhance 
              α 
              ‐diversity, it is unclear whether habitat restoration can re‐establish 
              β 
              ‐diversity. Using a long‐term pollinator dataset, comprising ∼9,800 specimens collected from the intensively managed agricultural landscape of the Central Valley of California, we show that on‐farm habitat restoration in the form of native plant ‘hedgerows’, when replicated across a landscape, can boost 
              β 
              ‐diversity by approximately 14\% relative to unrestored field margins, to levels similar to some natural communities. Hedgerows restore 
              β 
              ‐diversity by promoting the assembly of phenotypically diverse communities. Intensively managed agriculture imposes a strong ecological filter that negatively affects several important dimensions of community trait diversity, distribution, and uniqueness. However, by helping to restore phenotypically diverse pollinator communities, small‐scale restorations such as hedgerows provide a valuable tool for conserving biodiversity and promoting ecosystem services.},

Differences in beta diversity among different areas or groups of samples can be tested using this approach. The choice of transformation and dissimilarity measure has important consequences for interpreting results. For kelp holdfast assemblages from New Zealand, variation in species composition was greater in smaller holdfasts, while variation in relative abundances was greater in larger holdasts. Variation in community structure of Norwegian continental shelf macrobenthic fauna increased with increases in environmental heterogeneity, regardless of the measure used.

We provide a probabilistic derivation for the classic, incidence‐based forms of these indices and extend this approach to formulate new Jaccard‐type or Sørensen‐type indices based on species abundance data. We then propose estimators for these indices that include the effect of unseen shared species, based on either (replicated) incidence‐ or abundance‐based sample data. In sampling simulations, these new estimators prove to be considerably less biased than classic indices when a substantial proportion of species are missing from samples. Based on species‐rich empirical datasets, we show how incorporating the effect of unseen shared species not only increases accuracy but also can change the interpretation of results.},

	abstract = {Assessments of historical contingency have advanced our understanding of adaptive radiation and community ecology, but little attention has been given to assessing the importance of historical contingency in population ecology. An obstacle has been the unmet need to conceptualize historical contingencies for populations in a manner that allows for their explanatory power to be assessed and quantified so that it can be directly compared with the explanatory power of statistical models representing other hypotheses or theory-based explanations. Here we conceptualize historical contingencies as a 
              series of random events characterized by (1) significant legacy effects that are comparable in length to the waiting time between such events, and (2) the disparate nature of individual events in the series 
              . From that conceptualization, we present a simple quantitative framework for assessing the explanatory power of historical contingencies in population ecology and apply it to an existing long-term dataset on the predator-prey system in Isle Royale National Park. The population-level phenomenon that we focused on was predation rate because it is a synthesis of three basic elements in population ecology (predator abundance, prey abundance and kill rate). We also compared the explanatory power of models of the historical contingency hypothesis to a wide-range of alternative, theory-based, statistical models used to assess underlying mechanisms or forecast future dynamics. Models of the historical contingency hypothesis explained over half of the interannual variation in predation rate and performed similarly, or better than, the vast majority of alternative, theory-based, models. Those findings highlight the potential value of reconsidering the way that population ecologists traditionally attempt to explain phenomena. We also discuss how this new conceptualization of the historical contingency hypothesis can also be valuable for synthesizing several other important ecological concepts of broad significance, especially reddened spectra, tipping points, alternative stable states, and ecological surprises. If the historical contingency hypothesis were found to be broadly applicable, then it would likely explain why ecologists are conspicuously poor at forecasting future dynamics.},

Direct effects include mortality, injury, and displacement affecting at most two generations – adults and any immature progeny present during the fire. To study the direct effects of fire on bees, two criteria must be met. First, bees must be sampled soon after the fire event, before colonists arrive from outside the burn. Second, sampling locations must be far enough into the burned habitat to ensure that bees observed are survivors, and not foragers nesting outside the burn. 
            2. Bees were systematically sampled far inside ({\textgreater}7 km) and outside the burn perimeter immediately following a massive wildfire that burned primarily at night in sagebrush steppe habitat. Because adult females sleep in their nests, it was hypothesised that females of species with nests {\textgreater}10 cm underground would be safe from lethal heat, whereas females with shallow or above‐ground nests would be vulnerable. It was also hypothesised that fire would kill proportionately more males, as they typically sleep above ground. 
            3. Adult bees were present at all burned sample sites 14 and 21 days after the fire started. Many females were observed transporting pollen, indicative of active nest provisioning. Among the guild of bees surveyed at wild sunflowers (the only surviving flowering plant), fewer species were active within the burn. Guild composition was significantly altered, particularly by loss or depletion of several (but not all) sunflower specialists. Sex ratios did not shift, possibly due to surviving males aggregating in remaining patches of sunflowers.},

              Background 
              Ecological disturbance is a major driver of ecosystem structure and evolutionary selection, and theory predicts that the frequency and/or intensity of disturbance should determine its effects on communities. However, adaptations of species pools to different historical disturbance regimes are rarely considered in the search for generalizable community responses to disturbance. To explore how the severity of disturbance affects plant diversity patterns, we review studies of understorey plant community responses to wildfire in conifer forests of western North America across a gradient of departure from historical fire regimes. 
             
             
              Review findings 
              We find that post‐fire plant species richness may generally be maximized at disturbance severities that match the predominant historical disturbance regime in a given ecosystem. Studies that examined multiple spatial scales indicate that plant community responses to fire are likely to be scale dependent, suggesting that post‐disturbance monitoring should consider community responses at multiple scales. 
             
             
              Synthesis 
              Our review highlights that consideration of historical disturbance regimes might improve the ability to predict the effects of disturbance on communities. We discuss future research needs; quantitative studies that compare community responses to fire at multiple scales across different historical fire regimes would be particularly useful. Ultimately, consideration of disturbance as a multivariate problem is likely to lead to greater inference than traditional bivariate approaches.},

	abstract = {Pollination plays a significant role in the agriculture sector and serves as a basic pillar for crop production. Plants depend on vectors to move pollen, which can include water, wind, and animal pollinators like bats, moths, hoverflies, birds, bees, butterflies, wasps, thrips, and beetles. Cultivated plants are typically pollinated by animals. Animal-based pollination contributes to 30\% of global food production, and bee-pollinated crops contribute to approximately one-third of the total human dietary supply. Bees are considered significant pollinators due to their effectiveness and wide availability. Bee pollination provides excellent value to crop quality and quantity, improving global economic and dietary outcomes. This review highlights the role played by bee pollination, which influences the economy, and enlists the different types of bees and other insects associated with pollination.},

            Disconnected habitat fragments are poor at supporting population and community persistence; restoration ecologists, therefore, advocate for the establishment of habitat networks across landscapes. Few empirical studies, however, have considered how networks of restored habitat patches affect metacommunity dynamics. Here, using a 10‐year study on restored hedgerows and unrestored field margins within an intensive agricultural landscape, we integrate occupancy modelling with network theory to examine the interaction between local and landscape characteristics, habitat selection and dispersal in shaping pollinator metacommunity dynamics. We show that surrounding hedgerows and remnant habitat patches interact with the local floral diversity, bee diet breadth and bee body size to influence site occupancy, via colonisation and persistence dynamics. Florally diverse sites and generalist, small‐bodied species are most important for maintaining metacommunity connectivity. By providing the first in‐depth assessment of how a network of restored habitat influences long‐term population dynamics, we confirm the conservation benefit of hedgerows for pollinator populations and demonstrate the importance of restoring and maintaining habitat networks within an inhospitable matrix.},

            Fire is a major disturbance factor in many terrestrial ecosystems, leading to landscape transformation in fire‐prone areas. Species in mutualistic interactions are often highly sensitive to disturbances like fire events, but the degree and complexity of their responses are unclear. We use bipartite insect–flower interaction networks across a recently burned landscape to explore how plant–pollinator interaction networks respond to a recent major fire event at the landscape level, and where fire refuges were present. We also investigate the effectiveness of these refuges at different elevations (valley to hilltop) for the conservation of displaced flower‐visiting insects during fire events. Then, we explore how the degree of specialization of flower‐visiting insects changes across habitats with different levels of fire impact. We did this in natural areas in the Greater Cape Floristic Region (GCFR) biodiversity hotspot, which is species rich in plants and pollinators. Bees and beetles were the most frequent pollinators in interactions, followed by wasps and flies. Highest interaction activity was in the fire refuges and least in burned areas. Interactions also tracked flower abundance, which was highest in fire refuges in the valley and lowest in burned areas. Interactions consisted mostly of specialized flower visitors, especially in refuge areas. The interaction network and species specialization were lowest in burned areas. However, species common to at least two fire classes showed no significant difference in species specialization. We conclude that flower‐rich fire refuges sustain plant–pollinator interactions, especially those involving specialized species, in fire‐disturbed landscape. This may be an important shelter for specialized pollinator species at the time that the burned landscape goes through regrowth and succession as part of ecosystem recovery process after a major fire event.},

              In recent decades, many bumble bee species have declined due to changes in habitat, climate, and pressures from pathogens, pesticides, and introduced species. The western bumble bee ( 
              Bombus occidentalis 
              ), once common throughout western North America, is a species of concern and will be considered for listing by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) under the Endangered Species Act (ESA). We attempt to improve alignment of data collection and research with USFWS needs to consider redundancy, resiliency, and representation in the upcoming species status assessment. We reviewed existing data and literature on 
              B. occidentalis 
              , highlighting information gaps and priority topics for research. Priorities include increased knowledge of trends, basic information on several life‐history stages, and improved understanding of the relative and interacting effects of stressors on population trends, especially the effects of pathogens, pesticides, climate change, and habitat loss. An understanding of how and where geographic range extent has changed for the two subspecies of 
              B. occidentalis 
              is also needed. We outline data that could be easily collected in other research projects that would increase their utility for understanding range‐wide trends of bumble bees. We modeled the overall trend in occupancy from 1998 to 2018 of 
              Bombus occidentalis 
              within the continental United States using existing data. The probability of local occupancy declined by 93\% over 21 yr from 0.81 (95\% CRI = 0.43, 0.98) in 1998 to 0.06 (95\% CRI = 0.02, 0.16) in 2018. The decline in occupancy varied spatially by landcover and other environmental factors. Detection rates vary in both space and time, but peak detection across the continental United States occurs in mid‐July. We found considerable spatial gaps in recent sampling, with limited sampling in many regions, including most of Alaska, northwestern Canada, and the southwestern United States. We therefore propose a sampling design to address these gaps to best inform the ESA species status assessment through improved assessment of how the spatial distribution of stressors influences occupancy changes. Finally, we request involvement via data sharing, participation in occupancy sampling with repeated visits to distributed survey sites, and complementary research to address priorities outlined in this paper.},

                  Over the past decade, several foodborne disease outbreaks provoked widespread reforms to the fresh produce industry. Subsequent concerns about wildlife vectors and contaminated manures created pressure on growers to discontinue use of manure‐based composts and remove nearby semi‐natural vegetation. Despite widespread adoption, impacts of these practices on ecosystem services such as pest control have not been assessed. 
                 
                 
                  We used a landscape‐scale field experiment to quantify associations between compost applications, semi‐natural vegetation, pest control services and lettuce yields on organic farms throughout California's Central Coast, a region experiencing food safety reforms. 
                 
                 
                  We found that farms with surrounding semi‐natural vegetation supported a diverse arthropod assemblage, whereas a herbivore‐dominated assemblage occupied farms in simplified landscapes. Moreover, predatory arthropods consumed more herbivores at sites with more surrounding non‐crop vegetation and reduced aphid pest infestations in lettuce. 
                 
                 
                   
                    Compost improved lettuce yields by increasing soil nutrients and organic matter, but affected neither pest control nor 
                    Escherichia coli

Our results demonstrate that two practices – elimination of manure‐based composts and removal of non‐crop vegetation – are likely having negative impacts on arthropod biodiversity, pest control and soil quality. Critically, our findings and previous research suggest that compost can be applied safely and that habitat removal is likely ineffective at mitigating food safety risk. There is thus scope for co‐managing fresh produce fields for food safety, ecosystem services, and biodiversity through applying appropriately treated composts and stopping habitat removal.

              Managed and wild pollinators often cohabit in both managed and natural ecosystems. The western honeybee, 
              Apis mellifera 
              , is the most widespread managed pollinator species. Due to its density and behaviour, it can potentially influence the foraging activity of wild pollinators, but the strength and direction of this effect are often context-dependent. Here, we observed plant–pollinator interactions in 51 grasslands, and we measured functional traits of both plants and pollinators. Using a multi-model inference approach, we explored the effects of honeybee abundance, temperature, plant functional diversity, and trait similarity between wild pollinators and the honeybee on the resource overlap between wild pollinators and the honeybee. Resource overlap decreased with increasing honeybee abundance only in plant communities with high functional diversity, suggesting a potential diet shift of wild pollinators in areas with a high variability of flower morphologies. Moreover, resource overlap increased with increasing trait similarity between wild pollinators and the honeybee. In particular, central-place foragers of family Apidae with proboscis length similar to the honeybee exhibited the highest resource overlap. Our results underline the importance of promoting functional diversity of plant communities to support wild pollinators in areas with a high density of honeybee hives. Moreover, greater attention should be paid to areas where pollinators possess functional traits similar to the honeybee, as they are expected to be more prone to potential competition with this species.},

            Wildfires devastated communities in Oregon and Washington in September 2020, burning almost as much forest west of the Cascade Mountain crest (“the westside”) in 2 weeks ({\textasciitilde}340,000 ha) as in the previous five decades ({\textasciitilde}406,00 ha). Unlike dry forests of the interior western United States, temperate rain forests of the Pacific Northwest have experienced limited recent fire activity, and debates surrounding what drove the 2020 fires, and management strategies to adapt to similar future events, necessitate a scientific evaluation of the fires. We evaluate five questions regarding the 2020 Labor Day fires: (1) How do the 2020 fires compare with historical fires? (2) How did the roles of weather and antecedent climate differ geographically and from the recent past (1979–2019)? (3) How do fire size and severity compare to other recent fires (1985–2019), and how did forest management and prefire forest structure influence burn severity? (4) What impact will these fires have on westside landscapes? and (5) How can we adapt to similar fires in the future? Although 5 of the 2020 fires were much larger than any others in the recent past and burned {\textasciitilde}10 times the area in high‐severity patches {\textgreater}10,000 ha, the 2020 fires were remarkably consistent with historical fires. Reports from the early 1900s, along with paleo‐ and dendro‐ecological records, indicate similar and potentially even larger wildfires over the past millennium, many of which shared similar seasonality (late August/early September), weather conditions, and even geographic locations. Consistent with the largest historical fires, strong east winds and anomalously dry conditions drove the rapid spread of high‐severity wildfire in 2020. We found minimal difference in burn severity among stand structural types related to previous management in the 2020 fires. Adaptation strategies for similar fires in the future could benefit by focusing on ignition prevention, fire suppression, and community preparedness, as opposed to fuel treatments that are unlikely to mitigate fire severity during extreme weather. While scientific uncertainties remain regarding the nature of infrequent, high‐severity fires in westside forests, particularly under climate change, adapting to their future occurrence will require different strategies than those in interior, dry forests.},
